<div>

LightweightM2M is a fast deployable client-server specification that
provides a machine to machine service.

LightweightM2M is principally a device management protocol that has been
designed to be extensible to meet application requirements.
LightweightM2M is not restricted to device management, it can be used to
transfer service / application data.

LightweightM2M defines the interface between M2M device and M2M Server.
It enables the M2M Service Provider to deploy a M2M system to provide
service to the M2M user.

## Release Directories Naming Convention

The naming convention for the release directories is:  
Version - Year Month Day - Release Status  
e.g V1\_0-20161215-C

The ETS directory contains interoperability and/or conformance test
cases.

The EVP directory contains documents describing the validation criteria
for approving the related enabler. These documents have been
discontinued and the relevant sections have been added to the ETS
appendix.

It is recommended that the latest suitable release be selected unless an
earlier release is specifically required.

## Release Status

  - **Approved (A)**  
    When a Candidate Release has undergone a period of public comment
    and completed any applicable interoperability testing then it is
    published as an Approved Release.
  - **Candidate (C)**  
    As soon as the documents making up the Release have been approved by
    OMA, they are published as a Candidate Release.
  - **Draft (D)**  
    Unapproved documents are available as Draft documents.
  - **Historic (H)**  
    The Historic state is used for documents that have been made
    obsolete and which OMA SpecWorks no longer intends to maintain.

## Document File Types

  - **Architecture Document (AD)**  
    The Architecture Document contains an architecture diagram, protocol
    endpoints description, interfaces definition and detailed
    descriptions for the OMA LightweightM2M enabler. The architecture
    diagram shows the client and server components in this enabler as
    well as the interfaces between these two components. Furthermore, it
    gives a short description for the functions of these interfaces.
  - **Enabler Release Definition (ERELD)**  
    Lists all the component files in the release.
  - **Enabler Test Specification (ETS)**  
    This document describes in detail the available test cases for
    LightweightM2M as specified in the Technical Specifications. The
    test cases are split into two categories, conformance and
    interoperability test cases. The conformance test cases are aimed to
    verify the adherence to normative requirements described in the
    technical specifications. The interoperability test cases are aimed
    to verify that implementations of the specifications work
    satisfactory.
  - **Enabler Validation Plan (EVP)**  
    This document details the Validation plan for the LightweightM2M
    V1.0 Enabler Release. The successful accomplishment of the
    validation activities will be required for the Enabler to be
    considered for Approved status. The validation plan is based on
    testing expectations in the Enabler Test Requirements (ETR). While
    the specific test activities to be performed are described in the
    Enabler Test Specification (ETS) the test environment is described
    in this plan. This test environment details infrastructure,
    operational and participation requirements identified for the
    testing activities. These documents have been discontinued and the
    relevant sections have been added to the ETS appendix.
  - **Objects (SUP XML)**  
    LwM2M Object definitions.
  - **Requirements Document (RD)**  
    The Requirements Document contains use cases and requirements for
    the OMA LightweightM2M enabler. It describes a set of functional
    requirements for M2M service enablement between the LwM2M Server and
    the LwM2M Client and the device management from the LwM2M Server to
    the LwM2M Clients.
  - **Technical Specification (TS)**  
    The Technical Specification documents specify the Lightweight
    Machine-to-Machine (LwM2M) protocol that includes a simple resource
    model, operations for creation, update, deletion, and retrieval of
    resources, asynchronous notifications of resource changes, support
    for several serialization formats, UDP and SMS transport support,
    communication security based on the DTLS and support for use of
    multiple LwM2M Servers.
  - **XML Schema (SUP XSD)**  
    The LwM2M XML Schema definition for the LwM2M Objects.
